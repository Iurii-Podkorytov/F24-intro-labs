# Cloud Computing Lab - Artifact Registries and Serverless Computing Platforms

## Task 1: Artifact Registries Research

### AWS Artifact Registry

**Name:** Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR)

* Fully managed Docker container registry.
* Secure storage and management of container images.
* Integration with other AWS services like ECS, EKS, and CodePipeline.
* Supports image scanning for vulnerabilities.
* Replication for high availability and low latency access.
* Private and public repositories.

### GCP Artifact Registry

**Name:** Google Artifact Registry

* Fully managed repository for storing and managing artifacts like container images, language packages, and Maven packages.
* Supports multiple artifact types (Docker, Maven, npm, etc.).
* Integration with other GCP services like Cloud Build, Kubernetes Engine (GKE), and Cloud Run.
* Fine-grained access control and security features.
* Multi-regional repositories for high availability.
* Supports both private and public repositories.

### Azure Artifact Registry

**Name:** Azure Container Registry (ACR)

* Managed registry for storing and managing Docker container images.
* Supports different authentication mechanisms.
* Integration with other Azure services like Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure DevOps, and Azure Pipelines.
* Image scanning for vulnerabilities.
* Geo-replication for high availability and low latency.
* Private and public repositories.

## Task 2: Serverless Computing Platform Research

### AWS Serverless Computing Platform

**Name:** AWS Lambda

* Execute code without provisioning or managing servers.
* Supports multiple programming languages.
* Scales automatically based on demand.
* Pay-per-use pricing model.
* Integrates with various AWS services.
* Event-driven architecture.

### GCP Serverless Computing Platform

**Name:** Google Cloud Functions

* Event-driven, serverless compute platform.
* Supports multiple programming languages.
* Scales automatically.
* Pay-per-use pricing.
* Integrates with other GCP services.
* Highly scalable and reliable.

### Azure Serverless Computing Platform

**Name:** Azure Functions

* Serverless compute service that lets you run event-triggered code without managing servers.
* Supports multiple programming languages.
* Scales automatically.
* Pay-per-use pricing model.
* Integrates with other Azure services.
* Various deployment options (App Service, Kubernetes, etc.).
